# A Brief summary of the Model:

#### The model deployed in this project is a chained framework that creates stories for a series of images (task commonly known as Visual Storytelling). In order to do so, this task is dealt as a two-step problem, where first a captioner model creates descriptions for capturing the existential information in the sequence of images and a storyteller uses and reformulates these captions to a semantically enriched and coherent story.  

# How to Use:

__Step 1__: Download the 'models_to_use' folder and store somewhere locally (~2GB). 

__Step 2__: Download the files 'helper.py' and 'presentation.py' from the folder 'code_new' and store them locally under the same directory. 

__Step 3__: Create a folder locally with five images of yours choice or pull one of the folders present under the name 'Visual Stories'

__Step 4__: Make the necessary adjustments (regarding the paths) on the file 'presentation.py' and run the file.
